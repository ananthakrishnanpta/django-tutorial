# Automatic ORM feature in django

- ORM stands for **O**bject **R**elational **M**apping.
- **Objects** of a *class* is **mapped** to *records* of a **relational** database.

## Points to remember
### DDL statements are generated by tracking changes to the `models.py` file.
- Any change to this file, we need to stop the server and run two commands.
  - `python manage.py makemigrations` to generate the DDL scripts to run on the DB
  - `python manage.py migrate` to use those scripts and migrate the schema changes to the DB
  
### DML statements and DQL statements are generated from the `views.py`file.
- Since DML and DQL operations are required to run for user operations, these need to run realtime.
- When user makes any requests, the view functions will generate necessary queries realtime and send to DB.
- For example:
  - In a shopping website project, if we want to collect all the product records from the DB,
    - In the views.py we write, `products = Product.objects.all()`.
    - Here, `<ClassName>.objects.all()` is an object method inherited from the predefined `Model` class from `django.db`.
    - Whenever this view function runs, the following DQL statement will be generated and run:
      - `SELECT * FROM PRODUCTS;`
- For these no need to run the migration commands since these are not affecting the schema.

REST API Tutorial in Python (Theory)

What is REST?

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications.

It uses HTTP to enable communication between client and server.

RESTful APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) provide a way for applications to interact with each other over the web.


Key Features of REST:

1. Stateless: Each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.


2. Client-Server Architecture: Separation of concerns, where the client handles the user interface, and the server manages the backend.


3. Uniform Interface: A consistent way to interact with resources via standard HTTP methods.


4. Resource Identification: Resources are identified using URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).


5. Representations: Resources can be represented in multiple formats like JSON, XML, or plain text (JSON is the most commonly used).


6. Cacheable: Responses can be cached for better performance.

HTTP Methods in REST:

GET: Retrieve data from the server.

POST: Send data to the server to create a new resource.

PUT: Update an existing resource.

PATCH: Partially update an existing resource.

DELETE: Remove a resource.

REST API Concepts:

1. Endpoints: Specific URLs that provide access to resources.

Example: /users for a list of users, /users/{id} for a specific user.



2. Headers: Provide additional information in requests or responses (e.g., Content-Type: application/json).


3. Request Body: Used with methods like POST or PUT to send data to the server.


4. Status Codes: Indicate the result of the request.

200: OK

201: Created

400: Bad Request

404: Not Found

500: Internal Server Error

RESTful APIs in Python Python provides several libraries for building RESTful APIs. The most commonly used ones are:

1. Flask: A lightweight micro-framework.


2. Django REST Framework (DRF): Built on top of Django, providing a robust structure for APIs.


3. FastAPI: Known for its high performance and ease of use.

Steps to Create a REST API:

1. Set up a Python environment.


2. Choose a framework (e.g., Flask, Django, or FastAPI).


3. Define routes (endpoints) and HTTP methods.


4. Handle requests and send appropriate responses.


5. Test the API using tools like Postman or cURL.

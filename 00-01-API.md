# **API Tutorial**  

## **What is an API?**  
API stands for **Application Programming Interface**. Think of it as a middleman that lets two applications talk to each other. For example:  
- You use a mobile app to book a cab. The app sends your request to a server via an API, and the server processes it and sends back the cab details to the app, all through the API.  

### **Simple Analogy**  
Imagine you're at a restaurant:  
1. You (the customer) are like an **application**.  
2. The chef (kitchen) is the **server**.  
3. The waiter is the **API**, taking your order to the kitchen and bringing back your food.

## **Why Do We Need APIs?**  
APIs allow different systems to work together. Without APIs:  
1. Apps and websites wouldn't be able to fetch or send information.  
2. Systems would need to be tightly coupled, making them complex.  

### **Everyday Uses of APIs:**  
- Checking weather updates in an app.  
- Paying online using payment gateways like PayPal or Razorpay.  
- Using Google Maps to locate places inside other apps.

## **Types of APIs**  

### **1. Based on Usage**  
1. **Web APIs**  
   - These are accessed over the internet.  
   - Example: When you search on Google, a Web API fetches the results for you.  

2. **Library APIs**  
   - These are used by developers inside programs.  
   - Example: A Python library like NumPy lets you perform calculations using its built-in API.  

3. **Operating System APIs**  
   - These allow apps to interact with your device's operating system.  
   - Example: Android APIs let apps control the camera or GPS.

### **2. Based on Accessibility**  
1. **Open APIs (Public APIs):**  
   - Accessible to everyone.  
   - Example: Twitter API to fetch tweets.  

2. **Internal APIs:**  
   - Used only within an organization.  
   - Example: A bank's internal API for customer data.  

3. **Partner APIs:**  
   - Shared with specific business partners.  
   - Example: An e-commerce website using PayPal's API for payments.  

4. **Composite APIs:**  
   - Combine multiple APIs into one.  
   - Example: An app showing weather, traffic, and calendar events together.

## **HTTP Methods in APIs**  
When APIs communicate over the web, they use **HTTP methods** to define actions. Think of these like commands for specific tasks.

### **1. GET**  
Used to retrieve (read) information from the server.  
**Example:**  
- You open an e-commerce website to see the list of products.  
- The app sends a **GET request** to fetch product data.  

```http
GET /products
```  

---

### **2. POST**  
Used to send (write) data to the server, often to create something new.  
**Example:**  
- You register for a website. The app sends your information to the server.  

```http
POST /register
Body: { "username": "John", "email": "john@example.com" }
```  

---

### **3. PUT**  
Used to update existing information on the server.  
**Example:**  
- You update your profile picture on a social media platform.  

```http
PUT /users/123
Body: { "profile_picture": "new_picture_url" }
```  

---

### **4. DELETE**  
Used to remove data from the server.  
**Example:**  
- You delete a product from your cart.  

```http
DELETE /cart/items/45
```

## **What is REST?**  
REST (Representational State Transfer) is a design style for building APIs.  

### **REST Principles**  
1. **Resources Are Key:**  
   - Everything in REST is treated as a resource, like a user, product, or order.  
   - Each resource has a unique URL.  
   Example:  
   - `/users` → Represents all users.  
   - `/users/123` → Represents user with ID 123.  

2. **Stateless Communication:**  
   - Every request must contain all the information needed.  
   - The server does not remember anything between requests.  

3. **HTTP Methods:**  
   - RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.  

4. **Data Formats:**  
   - RESTful APIs commonly use JSON for sending and receiving data.

## **What are RESTful APIs?**  
RESTful APIs follow the REST principles. They are lightweight, fast, and easy to use.

## **Examples of RESTful API Usage**  

### **1. Weather Application**  
You want to check the weather in London. You send a GET request to the weather API.  
```http
GET /weather?city=London
Response: { "temperature": "15°C", "condition": "Cloudy" }
```  

---

### **2. Social Media Post**  
You post a new tweet on Twitter. You send a POST request to the Twitter API.  
```http
POST /statuses/update
Body: { "status": "Hello World!" }
```  

---

### **3. E-commerce Website**  
**Scenario:** You are shopping online.  
1. **Add to Cart**  
   - **POST request** to add an item.  
   ```http
   POST /cart/items
   Body: { "item_id": 101, "quantity": 2 }
   ```  

2. **View Cart**  
   - **GET request** to see your cart.  
   ```http
   GET /cart/items
   ```  

3. **Remove Item**  
   - **DELETE request** to remove an item.  
   ```http
   DELETE /cart/items/101
   ```

## **Benefits of RESTful APIs**  
1. **Simplicity:** Uses standard HTTP methods.  
2. **Flexibility:** Can work with any programming language.  
3. **Scalability:** Lightweight design supports large systems.  
4. **Interoperability:** Allows different systems to work together.
